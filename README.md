# Personal Resume Website	
This web app consists of a single web page using AngularJS. AngularJS is not needed to accomplish what was done in this app but having little AngularJS experience, I decided to use it. This web app was built with free and open to use tools. Feel free to use any section of code needed.

## Installation
This web app uses [bower] to install dependencies. To find all dependencies used check the `bower.json` file in root. To install this web app, download and install `bower` and run `bower install` at root. Then simply run in a local environment, [xampp] works wonderfully.
