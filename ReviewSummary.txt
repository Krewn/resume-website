Hi I really like your page, it looks great and the code is well styled.

Reading it I felt that there could be more comments specifically pertaining to the js components 
which were rather short and lacking any real description or ovbious explaintion for being.

The major note I would make is that you aught to use CDN ! 
referencing your java scripts from centeralized locations has multiple benifits,
(from the slides)
1 ) Reduce page load times because files may be pre-cached.
2 )Faster web pages becasue of distributed datacenters
3 ) More consistent performance from reduced server load.

Finally I added A line to your css to mkae the text in the ul-navbar 
fade to white from blue on mouse off.
